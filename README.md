# task4

I’m happy to share my final task during the CodSoft internship, where I designed an e-commerce website called "Flower"! 🌸💐

I focused on combining an attractive design with ease of use to provide a simple and comfortable shopping experience. My goal was to make navigation smooth and the purchasing process enjoyable and hassle-free. 

I’m proud of this design and hope you like it! 🌟
